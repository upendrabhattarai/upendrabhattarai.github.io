Professional Summary
Molecular biologist and bioinformatician with expertise in multi-omics data generation, analysis, genome assembly, transcriptomics, and high-throughput sequencing. Skilled in applying statistical and computational approaches to complex biological datasets. In addition to bioinformatics, I have extensive molecular wet lab experience, including various sequencing library preparation. I have worked with diverse model organisms, including human, mouse, many different insects, and pathogen, analyzing sequencing data for studies in cancer genetics, Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, developmental biology, and host-parasite interactions. My expertise spans bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, CUT&RUN, and Iso-Seq, as well as long-read sequencing using PacBio and Nanopore for genome assembly and annotation. Additionally, I have a strong background in bioinformatics training and international research collaboration.
